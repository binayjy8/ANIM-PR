            <h3>The Animal</h3>
            <p>Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05
               million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates.
               It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth.
               Animals' body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They
               have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments,
               forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, 
               and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.

                The word "animal" comes from the Latin animalis, meaning 'having breath or soul'.[4]
                The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.[5] In colloquial 
                usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.[6][7][8][9] The term 
                "metazoa" is derived from the Ancient Greek μετα (meta, meaning "later") and ζῷᾰ (zōia, plural 
                of ζῷον zōion, meaning animal).[10][11]
